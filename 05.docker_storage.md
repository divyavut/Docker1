#### Layers
- Image has layers which is nothing but data.
- when container is created from image , the data which is added inside container, will be removed. When a folder is created inside the container, container creates a seperate layer called Writable layer.Technically called as Anonymous Volume(Writable layer).  when container is removed, Anonymous volume will be delete.

- Data has to be preserved before deleting the conatiner, so that the next time when container is created from the same image it should the preseved data.

#### Two types of Volumes
1. Named volume - it gets created with docker command with name in dcoker default  location i.e. /var/lib/docker/volumes/volume_name/_data
2. Host volume - its gets creates with mkdir, without a name and in selected location


### Docker command structure
- docker <object-type> <action> <object-name/parameters>
        docker volume ls ---> list the volume
        docker volume inspect volume_name --> inspect the volume
        docker volume rm volume_name --> removing the volume 
- docker create volume volume_name
- default physical location of the volume path in docker server : /var/lib/docker/volumes/volume_name/_data
- we can the volume path while creating container and stores the container data for future use. 
      
      docker run -dit --name bb03 -v Volume_name:path_of_container_folder_to_map_server_volume image_name

- Hosted volume 
        docker run -dit --name bb04 -v path_in_docker_server:path_of_container image_name 

- TempFS Volume : stores in server RAM(memory). when container deleted TempFs volume will be deleted. used to store in memory database cache(redis cache).

        docker run -dit --name bb05 --tmpfs /tmpfs_data busybox

### Storage mapping
- In docker we can only map directly local docker server volume to conatiner, but to map external storage devices like EBS, NFS from aws cloud provider use
 
    mount external/volume/path_url /local_docker_server_volume_path

- In docker, we can't map external volume directly to the container
### Kubernetes storage mapping
- In kubernetes, we can directly map external storage devices like EBS to containers.
