#### Compute 
- compute = CPU + RAM.
#### CPU
- docker stats --> shows the cpu and ram utilization of running containers
- In computer we have a motherboard. Cpu, hard disk,nic card,memory connects to motherboard.
- Operating system files either linux/windows system that will be in hard disk, when we power on operating system, it loads all operating system files to the ram(memory) beacause Ram is a device which does fastest read write operations.
- ms word, mas excel when we open it loads to memory, it makes the system slow when ram reaches 100 percent.
- cpu is expandable resource, ram is not a expandable resource.
- cpus changes its priority based on applications that are in background and foreground. cpu gives more priority to the applications which are running in foreground then background applciations. This process is called cpu shecduling mechanism.

#### RAM
- Ram is constant for all applications , it is not increasing or decreasing for any applications in Task Manager. There is no shceduling mechanism.
- If there is no space to load the applications in ram, we get the memory issues, graphical userinterface issues.

#### Note(Interview)
- capacity(cpu+ram) that is given to the container has been used by container continously, but when the ram limit capacity reaches, conatiner will be killed (OOMKilled). Out of memory killed(OOMKilled). when the CPU limit capacity reaches, it uses the cpu scheduling mechanism. So Container can get the cpu, so it called a expandable resources.

#### memory-swap 
- All application files are in hard disk by default (c/program files/applicatin_name). when we open the installed application at that time all files related tot he application will be loaded to the memory(ram). 
- when we open multiple applications then it starts loading the files into the memory and when memory gets fulled it starts swapping, we can see that in new model system. In windows we say it as page file (32 gb ram), if your laptob is 16 gb ram. Page file when it detects that the memory is fulled, the applications which are not in use, the swap file move it from memory to swap file.

- df -h 
- In linux, when we launch applications, when memory gets fulled, the files which are related to the application , swap can swap the files from memory to swap disk. In Linux we had a partition for swap disk.

        docker run -dit --name bb01 --memory="300m" --cpu-shares 512 --memory-swap "600m" busybox
